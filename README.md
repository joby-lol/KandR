# KandR
Here I will be working through the exercises in Kernighan & Ritchie's  *The C Programming Language - 2nd Edition*. I probably won't do all of them, and I'll start wherever they become remotely interesting -- the stuff in the really early chapters is kind of boring if you already know some things.

## A note on style
I'll be formatting my code according to the style standards of the class I happen to be taking at the moment.
